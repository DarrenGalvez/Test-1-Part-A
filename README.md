How to run: This program was ran using a windows machine, in which the latest version of MinGW must be installed and then debugged using the drop down menu and choose the option 'C/C++: g++.exe build and debug active file' if a windows device is being used.
            Once the program is compiled a terminal can be opened and then use the command code .\main.exe (also windows exclusive command) to run the program.
